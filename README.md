<h3>Configure Roles</h3>

<p>Roles define the permissions assigned to agents within specific departments they can access. Each role has a specific set of permissions that can be toggled on or off for agents assigned to that role and department. You can create and assign an unlimited number of roles to agents, allowing them access to different departments as needed.</p>

 - Admin Panel -> Agents -> Roles
 - "Supreme Admin" Role (A role to have complete control of every permission in the system)
